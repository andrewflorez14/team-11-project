America faces growing challenges related to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and
sustainable urban planning. Transportation is one of the largest contributors to CO₂ and methane
emissions in the state, largely due to poor urban design and long commute times. Our project
investigates how increasing the
walkability of American cities
could reduce emissions and
improve air quality. Using
publicly available datasets on
commute times, vehicle miles
traveled, and emissions profiles,
we will model the potential
environmental benefits of reducing reliance on vehicles. By comparing current transportation
patterns with scenarios that prioritize pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we aim to quantify how
improved walkability could lower CO₂ emissions and contribute to healthier, more sustainable
communities. These datasets are particularly suitable for this project because they directly link
human behavior (commuting) with measurable environmental impacts (emissions), allowing us
to evaluate both ethical and practical dimensions of urban planning. The expected outcome is a
data-driven assessment of the environmental and social benefits of walkable city design, offering
insight for policymakers, engineers, and planners seeking to balance economic growth with
ethical responsibility toward public health and climate sustainability.
