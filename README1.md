# ENG220 Project — Walkability and Emissions Analysis

### Team Members
- **Andrew Florez** — Project Manager, GitHub Workflow  
- **Logan Bermudez** — Dataset Research & Justification

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores how walkability metrics relate to urban CO₂ emissions using real-world datasets.  
We clean, analyze, and visualize data, then model hypothetical “mode-shift” scenarios where more people walk instead of drive.  
An interactive **Streamlit app** demonstrates how different assumptions affect emissions outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Research Goals
- Quantify correlations between walkability and CO₂ emissions.  
- Simulate mode-shift scenarios to estimate potential emission reductions.  
- Present interactive and reproducible results through a web app.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** — data cleaning and analysis  
- **Streamlit** — interactive dashboard  
- **GitHub** — version control and collaboration  
- **pandas, matplotlib, plotly** — data visualization
